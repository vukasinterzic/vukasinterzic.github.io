    <td>The easiest way to start with the WAC is to install it locally on your Windows 10 Client. This option can work great for small scenarios where only one user is using it for management. <br><br>

That client PC needs to have direct network access to managed servers. WAC will run as an application (not as a service) and it will be available on the address: https://localhost:6516</td>
