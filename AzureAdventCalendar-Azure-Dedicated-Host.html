			<p>Welcome to the day 19 of Azure Advent Calendar!</p>
			<p>Today we are going to talk about the Azure Dedicated Host. This is a new service offering in Microsoft Azure that was originally introduced in August 2019 as a Public Preview, and it is generally available since December 2019.</p>
	
			<p>Azure Dedicated Host provides a single-tenant physical server to host your Azure virtual machines for Windows and Linux. The server capacity is not shared with other customers. As a result, you can run general purpose, memory intensive or compute intensive workloads in a hardware-isolated and virtualized server environment dedicated to your organization. With Azure Dedicated Host, you can address specific compliance requirements while increasing visibility and control over your underlying infrastructure.</p>
			
			<p>As part of Azure Advent Calendar, I created a little video where you can find more information about it and see it in action:</p>

			<p>Happy learning and happy holidays.</p>
